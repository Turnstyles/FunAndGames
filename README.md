# Fun and Games with Discourse
Fun and Games with the Civlized Discourse Construction Kit

Thinking about writing an open source book on creating games that run in Discourse.

What would such a book cover?

## Creating Themes

* A Turnstyles Theme, black and white woodcut style
* An Old Imperial Theme, medieval tapestry
* A Space Opera Theme, neon vector svgs

## Creating Game Plugins 

* A game where the state can be saved in the message itself, tic tac toe on the simple side, chess on the complex side
* A game where parts of the state must be on the server because it must be hidden from the players, hangman, battleship
* A game where it uses an external service, a Fantasy Football league that uses customized scoring and Yahoo's YQL
* An interactive story that uses that interesting Choice of Games language.
* A colaborative mystery storytelling game, "The Plot Garden", "Old Imperial", or "Space Opera"
* A card game; 500, Boned or Dealers Choice Poker
